# Checkerboard-pattern for MOCAP Suit

We aim to make a novel motion capture suit which can track any body point in real time. 

**Algorithm** : Suit comprises of red and blue patterns with different amounts of intensity. Thus, a 3X3 matrix as captured by a simple high resolution camera will be sufficient to uniquely label a point.
